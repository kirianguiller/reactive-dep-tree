# Reactive Dep Tree

Interactive dependency trees in the browser !

## Description
Reactive-dep-tree is an html component made in Vuejs that allow to easily show interactive dependency trees on any html pages.

## Who need that ?
Linguist, NLP researcher/engineer and computer scientist who want to show dependency tree in the browser. 
It is currently being used in :
- [Arborator-Grew](https://arboratorgrew.elizia.net/#/) : A web-app for online collaborative dependency parsing.
- [Surface Syntactic SUD](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io) : A guideline on Surface Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD). Just check the website and try to interact with the dependency trees to have a live demo :D.

## How to implement in 2 steps

### 1 - Source the CDN repo
Add the link to the CDN library in the head of any HTML file

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/reactive-dep-tree@0.2.0/dist/reactive-dep-tree.umd.js" async deferred></script>
```

### 2 - Create a <reactive-dep-tree> html component
Add the reactive-dep-tree component with the wanted parameters
```html
<reactive-dep-tree
  interactive="true"
  conll="# text = I am eating a pineapple
    1	I	_	PRON	_	_	2	suj	_	_
    2	am	_	AUX	_	_	0	root	_	_
    3	eating	_	VERB	_	_	2	aux	_	_
    4	a	_	DET	_	_	5	det	_	_
    5	pineapple	_	NOUN	_	_	3	obj	_	_
"
></reactive-dep-tree>
```

You should see the corresponding tree appearing on your website :

<img src="docs/I_am_eating_a_pineapple.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
      />

## Parameters

### conll
Source representation of the tree. Must be a proper conll format.

### interactive
If true, allow any user to modify locally on his browser the dependency tree. It can allow users to do quick edit and then export the tree as PNG, SVG or conll format.

### Demo
If you want to see these trees in action, you can go to the [SUD Dependency guidelines](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/) and start interacting with the exposed trees. 

SUD is an annotation scheme for syntactic dependency treebanks, and has a nearly perfect degree of two-way convertibility with the Universal Dependencies scheme (UD). Contrary to UD, it is based on syntactic criteria (favoring functional heads) and the relations are defined on distributional and functional bases.

This website is a guideline on how to annotate in SUD for some specific languages

## Source
Thanks to Kim Gerdes his work on [Arborator-Draft](https://github.com/Arborator/arborator-draft) that was used heavily in this library (conll handling, svg drawing (with snap-svg)). Also thanks to GaÃ«l Guibon, Marine Courtin and the rest of the Arborator-Grew team for their valuable work on AG.


## Contributions
All contributions are welcomed.

### Set the project
```
git clone <url-for-this-repo>
git cd <this-repo>
npm install
```

### Run the dev version
```
npm run serve
```

### Information
- The file that will be render when serving the dev version will be `public/index.html` . You can change it as you please as this is not being compiled.
- For being able to use TS and to compile the code as a JS library, I "had" to create a main.js and a main.ts . main.*s are usually the entry points in vue projects, but only one is should be necessary. In our case, we need the two of them, but I'm sure we could succeed to keep only main.ts (if somehow we succeed to compile the code in a common.js directly from main.ts)

### TODO
- [ ] implement right-to-left logic (for languages such as Hebrew, Arabic, ...)
- [ ] write a better documentation (add information about passable parameters in the <reactive-dep-tree> component)
- [ ] add the possibility to pass the conll in a <conll> tag (for now, it is only passable as an attribute and force to add escaping characters if a quote is in the string of the conll)
- [ ] start implementing test
- [ ] export the core logic (reactiveSentence folder) in an external library, so it could be imported in this vue wrapper AND in arborator-grew (and in other wrapper, side libraries, etc ...)
